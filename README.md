Gangplank-Welcome
=================

The first thing you see when walking in to any Gangplank. Sign-in, collaborate, get a tour.

__Nothing here yet__

This is currently a simple HTML mock-up of the first screen. Feel free to replace this entirely... Currently looking at making this for iOS and / or Android for use on a tablet installed inside at the entrance. Framework may change but for now I'm assuming this will be created on Cordova.

See screen-shots of layout sketch (coming soon).
